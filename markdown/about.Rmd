# About

This Shiny app is created and maintained by <a href="https://michellekendall.github.io/" target="_blank">Michelle Kendall</a>. 

The results presented in tabs "March-June Pillar 1 tracker" and "March-June Pillar 1 synthetic controls" are an interactive version of the results of our <a href="https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.12.20151753v1" target="_blank">*medRxiv* preprint</a> evaluating the impact of the Test and Trace programme as it was rolled out in England on the Isle of Wight and then nationwide.

The "Daily tracker" tab which is updated daily builds upon the analysis of the paper, using a shorter waiting time between infection and swab date to reflect shorter times to Pillar 2 testing.

The "Cases by age" tab presents an analysis developed by Robert Hinch and is also updated daily.
