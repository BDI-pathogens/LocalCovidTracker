# About

This Shiny app is created and maintained by <a href="https://michellekendall.github.io/" target="_blank">Michelle Kendall</a>. 

The tabs "March-June Pillar 1 tracker" and "March-June Pillar 1 synthetic controls" provide an interactive version of the results of [1].

The "Daily tracker" tab which is updated daily builds upon our published analysis, using a shorter waiting time between infection and swab date to reflect shorter times to Pillar 2 testing.

The "Cases by age" tab presents an analysis developed by Robert Hinch and is also updated daily.

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/BDI-pathogens/LocalCovidTracker). 
Please let us know of any issues or requests via the [Issues](https://github.com/BDI-pathogens/LocalCovidTracker/issues) page.
